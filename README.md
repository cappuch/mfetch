pure python fetching util - slow but cross-platform, with cross platform being the main focus

cpu.py (custom) based off of cpuinfo by Pearu Peterson, but re-written by me (to be smaller lol)

cow icon (default icon is from https://www.asciiart.eu/animals/cows)

i keep the codebase as readable as possible, and try use pure python where possible (no external libraries) for dependency-less environments - code comments are used as a joke if i use them lol
all the modules for the code is in the root directory, with what they do being self-explanatory from their file names

i'm open to suggestions!
